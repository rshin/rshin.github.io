I am currently a Senior Researcher at Microsoft [Semantic Machines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/semantic-machines/).
My work leverages large language models to enable scalable construction of conversational AI systems.
I have also worked on various other projects relating to privacy, model compression, and crowdsourcing,
in collaboration with interns and teammates.

I'm interested in creating machines that can learn and reason about programs
to reliably understand and carry out complex human intentions.
I am excited both about applications like empowering non-technical users to
program, as well as contributing new perspectives on core challenges in AI
such as interpretability, generalization, and abstraction.

I received my PhD in [Computer Science](https://cs.berkeley.edu/)
at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu),
where I was advised by [Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong).
I was a member of the [Berkeley AI Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu) and have also collaborated with the [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/).
I also received my MS and BS degrees at UC Berkeley.
I've worked at
[Google AI](https://ai.google),
[Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html),
and [Microsoft Research AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/).

Previously, I have also done research relating to security applications of
machine learning, software security, and web security.
