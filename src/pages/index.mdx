I'm working on my PhD in [Compter Science](https://cs.berkeley.edu/)
at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu),
advised by [Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong).
I am a member of the [Berkeley AI Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu) and have also collaborated with the [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/).
Previously, I received my MS and BS degrees also at UC Berkeley.
I've worked at
[Google AI](https://ai.google),
[Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html),
and [Microsoft Research AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/).

I'm interested in creating machines that can learn and reason about programs
to reliably understand and carry out complex human intentions.
My research in neural program synthesis addresses challenges of generalizing
to new tasks and learning robustly from scarce supervision, by combining
symbolic and neural techniques to leverage hierarchy for scalable learning of
complex behaviors and to exploit the inherent structure of programs as trees
and graphs.

I am excited both about applications like empowering non-technical users to
program, as well as contributing new perspectives on core challenges in AI
such as interpretability, generalization, and abstraction.

Previously, I have also done research relating to security applications of
machine learning, software security, and web security.
